### üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Challenges for PPO on CartPole

1. **Discrete Actions Handling**: CartPole uses discrete actions (left/right), so we had to use a `Categorical` distribution instead of `Normal`. This changes how actions are sampled and log-probabilities are computed.
2. **Shared Network**: We used a single neural network with shared layers for both actor and critic, which helps with parameter efficiency but can lead to interference if not tuned well.
3. **Advantage Estimation**: We calculated advantages using the simple difference `returns - values`, and normalized them to stabilize training.
4. **Multiple Epoch Updates**: PPO requires updating the same batch several times. We had to carefully manage log probabilities and ratios to ensure stable learning.
5. **Gym Compatibility**: Recent changes in the Gym API required handling tuples when resetting or stepping the environment.
6. **Video Recording**: Gym's rendering had to be accessed using `render(mode='rgb_array')`, and OpenCV needed proper BGR conversion and resizing.

Despite being simpler than continuous control, PPO on CartPole still demanded precision in batching, advantage computation, and log-prob tracking.

### üìä Hyperparameter Impact Analysis

*Note: Detailed hyperparameter experiments were conducted on this environment, with insights applicable to other discrete control tasks.*

Our hyperparameter tuning experiments revealed several key insights:

1. **Learning Rate (LR)**: 
   - Higher learning rate (0.01) led to significantly faster convergence
   - Lower learning rate (0.0005) struggled to reach the solving threshold

2. **Discount Factor (GAMMA)**:
   - Higher discount (0.999) had more variance but eventually solved
   - Lower discount (0.90) learned quickly initially but had stability issues

3. **Clipping Range (EPS_CLIP)**:
   - Both values (0.1 and 0.3) solved successfully
   - Higher clipping (0.3) had slightly better early performance

4. **Update Epochs (K_EPOCH)**:
   - Lower value (1) struggled with learning speed
   - Higher value (10) solved very quickly, showing more updates help

### üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Challenges for PPO on MountainCarContinuous

1. **Continuous Action Sampling**: We had to use a `Normal` distribution instead of `Categorical`, introducing the need to manage `action_std` and diagonal covariance matrices.
2. **Action Standard Deviation Decay**: To reduce exploration over time, we decayed `action_std` every 200 episodes to help the agent converge.
3. **Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)**: We implemented GAE to reduce variance in advantage estimates using a lambda-weighted future reward structure.
4. **Separate Actor/Critic Networks**: Continuous actions benefited from separate actor and critic networks for better learning stability.
5. **Entropy Regularization**: We added an entropy bonus to encourage exploration, which was essential in early episodes where rewards are sparse.
6. **Gym Compatibility + Video Capture**: Gym's new step API required checking `terminated` and `truncated`, and video recording had to handle raw RGB frames with OpenCV.

MountainCarContinuous was trickier than CartPole due to continuous actions and sparse rewards ‚Äî we had to introduce action variance decay and GAE to learn successfully.

### üìä Hyperparameter Impact Analysis

   - Lower value (0.40) resulted in much slower learning due to limited exploration

2. **Clipping Parameter (EPS_CLIP)**:
   - Lower value (0.10) enabled faster learning and quicker convergence
   - Higher value (0.30) still solved the environment but took longer

3. **Training Epochs**:
   - Higher value (20) dramatically improved learning speed, solving in ~300 episodes
   - Lower value (5) struggled to make progress, highlighting the importance of sufficient updates

4. **GAE Lambda**:
   - Lower value (0.80) significantly improved learning speed, solving in ~400 episodes
   - Higher value (0.99) resulted in slower, more stable but less efficient learning
   
5. **Discount Factor (GAMMA)**:
   - Higher value (0.999) led to faster convergence by focusing on long-term returns
   - Lower value (0.90) resulted in slower learning due to shortsighted optimization

6. **Actor Learning Rate**:
   - Higher value (0.001) enabled faster policy updates and quicker convergence

2. **Twin Critics**: We needed two separate Q-networks to mitigate overestimation bias, requiring careful management of target networks.
3. **Automatic Temperature Tuning**: To automatically adjust the entropy coefficient, we had to implement a separate optimization process.
4. **Replay Buffer Management**: Efficient experience replay was crucial for off-policy learning in this sparse reward environment.

3. **Temperature Parameter (Œ±)**:
   - Lower values (0.1) led to fastest and most stable convergence, reaching ~95 reward consistently
   - Medium values (0.5) showed competitive performance but with more variability

### üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Challenges for TD3 on MountainCarContinuous

1. **Twin Delayed Critics**: Implementing two critic networks and delaying policy updates required careful synchronization.
2. **Target Policy Smoothing**: Adding noise to target actions helped prevent exploitation of Q-function errors.
